<img src="https://www.recipetineats.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Carbonara_6a.jpg">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Carbonara is a beautiful, classic Italian pasta that’s so creamy, you’d swear there’s a good amount of cream in it. And indeed, there’s plenty of recipes that cheat by adding in cream.

    But today, we’re making spaghetti carbonara properly, the authentic, traditional way. No cream. Just egg, cheese and a splash of starchy pasta cooking water.
    
    15 minutes later, THIS is the sight that will be in front of you. And you’ll make 60 million Italians beam with pride!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>175g/6 oz guanciale (pancetta or block bacon), weight after skin removed (Note 1)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs (Note 2)</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks (Note 2)</li>
        <li>100g/3.5 oz parmigiano reggiano , finely shredded (or pecorino romano, sub parmesan, Note 3)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>400g/14 oz spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cooking/kosher salt (for cooking pasta)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pasta cooking water</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Garnish (OPTIONAL):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Parmigiano reggiano</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Guanciale – Cut into 0.5cm / 1/5" thick slices then into batons.</li>
        <li>Carbonara sauce – Place eggs and yolks in a large bowl. Whisk to combine. Then stir in the parmesan and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook pasta – Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with the salt. Add pasta and cook per the packet directions.</li>
        <li>Reserve pasta water – Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>Pasta in pan – Tip the hot pasta into the pan and toss to coat in guanciale fat</li>
        <li>Mix pasta in sauce – Transfer the pasta and any residual fat in the pan into the bowl with the egg. Add 1/2 cup (125 ml) pasta cooking water. Stir vigorously using the handle of a wooden spoon for 1 minute and watch as the sauce transforms from watery to creamy and clings to the pasta strands!</li>
        <li>Serve – Transfer into warm bowls. Serve immediately, garnished with a little extra parmigiana reggiano if desired, and a pinch of black pepper and finely chopped parsley.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Recipe Notes:</h3>
    <p><bold>Economical note:</bold> Use bacon instead of guanciale and parmesan instead of parmigiano reggiano for a very respectable version of carbonara that will still make Italians proud. Just don’t add cream!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Guanciale is the cured pork traditionally used in carbonara. Sold in block form that you cut yourself, it can be found in Italian/speciality delis, Harris Farms (Syd, Brisbane) and some butchers. It’s very fatty and has a stronger flavour than pancetta and bacon. Substitute with block bacon or pancetta (so you can cut batons), or thick pre-sliced bacon. Must use streaky as sauce needs fat to thicken (read in post for why).</li>
        <li>Eggs – Use large eggs (cartons labelled as such) which are 55-60g / 2oz each. See here for easy ways to use/store leftover egg whites!</li>
        <li>Parmigiano reggiano is a premium aged type of parmesan. Pecorino is also commonly used. Sub parmesan. Do not use store bough pre-grated as it will not melt properly. Must finely shred it yourself! 100g/3.5oz is one tightly packed cup ie shred, put in a cup and pack it down tightly</li>
        <li>Garlic not traditional but it adds extra flavour and I can’t resist. Sorry Italy!</li>
        <li> Leftovers will keep for 3 days but pasta really is always best eaten freshly made, in particular for carbonara!</li>
